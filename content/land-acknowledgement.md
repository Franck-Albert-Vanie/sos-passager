# Land acknowledgement

Before beginning the workshop, we'd like to acknowledge the indigenous lands where we are located.    
Evan is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. Phil is located on the territories of the Ute, Cheyenne, and Arapahoe peoples, and would like to further acknowledge that 48 contemporary tribal nations are historically tied to the lands that make up Colorado.

Since all of you are spread around the continent, let's take a moment to explore [native-lands.ca](https://native-land.ca/) so that you can visualize the indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.
