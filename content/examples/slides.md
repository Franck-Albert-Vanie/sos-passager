# Adding presentation slides

## Reveal.js slides

## Google slides

## PowerPoint
I think you might be able to add your slides as a published slide deck using this method – [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/publish-your-presentation-to-the-web-558ae647-9919-4571-86a0-9a4a1ea48938](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/publish-your-presentation-to-the-web-558ae647-9919-4571-86a0-9a4a1ea48938) – Could add slides to the slide folder the same way we do with Reveal?
